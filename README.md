# fantasy_game
A fantasy role-playing game: there are four different types of creatures: humans, cyberdemons, balrogs, and elves. Make the Creature class's getSpecies() function a pure virtual function, so that every class that is derived from the Creature class will be required to implement a getSpecies() function.
